1. Serialized Data means key value pairs of states “teeth=32;head=1;feet=2;legs=2”
processing of data to key value pairs

2. cookies are stored in browser of client, because server says the client should create a specific cookie
and then in the next request the client puts the cookie there -> server can access it

server says client should set a cookie -> clients sets it -> another request

3. Cookies stored in client browser, small piece of data
