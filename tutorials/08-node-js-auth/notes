1. What does passport.serialize(user, callback) do?
--> serialize id of user to session, to keep amount of data stored in sessio small

2. What‘s the purpose of passing this object to LocalStrategy?
new LocalStrategy({
 usernameField: 'username',
 passwordField: 'password'
 },…)

--> passport uses strategies to authenticate requests.
They verify e.g a username and password.

3. Is the req.isAuthenticated() method built into the NodeJS
core?
No it is from Passport..

!! Maybe the stuff with the middleware graph is important
